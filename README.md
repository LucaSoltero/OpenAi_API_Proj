Utilized Open AI's API to create a web app that generates names for specific products/ businesses based on two given parameters: 
1. A product description
2. Seed/ Buzz words that generally describe your product

You can also generate a sales pitch for your product by providing the AI with a target audience and product description. Both algorithms used Open AIs
"text-davinci-003" model to generate the output for the sales pitches and business name ideas.
